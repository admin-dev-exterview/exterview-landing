        Exterview Services integrate with many third party applications
        (hereinafter “Third Party Application(s)”). Access and use of the Third
        Party Applications may require acceptance of terms of service and
        privacy policies applicable to such Third Party Applications

        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">Fees and Payments</h2>
        The Services are available under subscription plans of various
        durations. Payments for subscription plans of duration of less than a
        year can be made only by Credit Card. Your subscription will be
        automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you
        downgrade your paid subscription plan to a free plan or inform us that
        you do not wish to renew the subscription. At the time of automatic
        renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the Credit Card last
        used by you. We provide you the option of changing the details if you
        would like the payment for the renewal to be made through a different
        Credit Card. If you do not wish to renew the subscription, you must
        inform us at least seven days prior to the renewal date. If you have not
        downgraded to a free plan and if you have not informed us that you do
        not wish to renew the subscription, you will be presumed to have
        authorized Exterview to charge the subscription fee to the Credit Card
        last used by you. From time to time, we may change the price of any
        Service or charge for use of Services that are currently available free
        of charge. Any increase in charges will not apply until the expiry of
        your then current billing cycle. You will not be charged for using any
        Service unless you have opted for a paid subscription plan. In the event
        any tax such as GST, VAT, sales tax or the like is chargeable by
        Exterview in accordance with any local, state, provincial or foreign
        laws with respect to your subscription to our Services (“Taxes”),
        Exterview will invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to pay Exterview
        such Taxes in addition to the subscription fees. Exterview shall provide
        you with an invoice in the format prescribed by the applicable local,
        state, provincial or foreign laws to help you avail the applicable input
        tax credit for the Taxes so paid.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">
          Organization Accounts and Administrators
        </h2>
        When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify
        one or more administrators. The administrators will have the right to
        configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users
        in your organization account. If your organization account is created
        and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such
        third party has assumed administrator role for your organization. Make
        sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party
        specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as an administrator of
        your organization account. You are responsible for (i) ensuring
        confidentiality of your organization account password, (ii) appointing
        competent individuals as administrators for managing your organization
        account, and (iii) ensuring that all activities that occur in connection
        with your organization account comply with this Agreement. You
        understand that Exterview is not responsible for account administration
        and internal management of the Services for you. You are responsible for
        taking necessary steps for ensuring that your organization does not lose
        control of the administrator accounts. You may specify a process to be
        followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of
        the administrator accounts by sending an email to legal@Exterview.in,
        provided that the process is acceptable to Exterview. In the absence of
        any specified administrator account recovery process, Exterview may
        provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing
        proof satisfactory to Exterview demonstrating authorization to act on
        behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold Exterview liable for
        the consequences of any action taken by Exterview in good faith in this
        regard.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">

        </h2>

        governed by Exterview Privacy Policy. Your election to use the Service
        indicates your acceptance of the terms of the Exterview Privacy Policy.
        You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your username,
        password and other sensitive information. You are responsible for all
        activities that occur in your user account and you agree to inform us
        immediately of any unauthorized use of your user account by email to
        contact@Exterview.in or by calling us on any of the numbers listed on
        https://Exterview.ai/contact/. We are not responsible for any loss or
        damage to you or to any third party incurred as a result of any
        unauthorized access and/or use of your user account, or otherwise.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">
          Communications from Exterview
        </h2>
        The Service may include certain communications from Exterview, such as
        service announcements, administrative messages and newsletters. You
        understand that these communications shall be considered part of using
        the Services. As part of our policy to provide you total privacy, we
        also provide you the option of opting out from receiving newsletters
        from us. However, you will not be able to opt-out from receiving service
        announcements and administrative messages.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">Complaints</h2>
        If we receive a complaint from any person with respect to your
        activities as part of use of the Services (other than where the
        grievance redressal mechanism provided under the head “Grievance
        Redressal” applies), we will forward the complaint to the primary email
        address of your user account. You must respond to the complainant
        directly within 10 days of receiving the complaint forwarded by us and
        copy Exterview in the communication. If you do not respond to the
        complainant within 10 days from the date of our email to you, we may
        disclose your name and contact information to the complainant for
        enabling the complainant to take legal action against you. You
        understand that your failure to respond to the forwarded complaint
        within the 10 days’ time limit will be construed as your consent to
        disclosure of your name and contact information by Exterview to the
        complainant.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">
          Inactive User Accounts Policy
        </h2>
        We reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts that are inactive
        for a continuous period of 120 days. In the event of such termination,
        all data associated with such user account will be deleted. We will
        provide you prior notice of such termination and option to back-up your
        data. The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or
        all of the Services. Each Service will be considered an independent and
        separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of
        inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not
        sufficient to keep your user account in another Service active. In case
        of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is
        active, the account will not be considered inactive.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">Hosting Location</h2>
        The location of the cloud facility from which you are served depends on
        the mapping of your region/country to the available cloud facilities at
        the time of your sign-up. We may migrate your account or require you to
        migrate your account to a different cloud facility in the event of any
        updates to the region/country to cloud facility mapping at any point of
        time. You must not mask your internet protocol (IP) address at the time
        of sign-up since your region/country is determined base on your IP
        address. If, at any time, your actual region/country is found to be
        different from the region/country in our records, Exterview may take
        appropriate action such as migrate your account or require you to
        migrate your account to the cloud facility corresponding to your
        region/country, or close your account and deny the Service to you. If
        you are served from a cloud facility outside your region/country and a
        Exterview group entity has an office in your region/country, apart from
        storing the data in the cloud facility assigned to you, we may store a
        local copy of the data in your region/country.
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold  py-5">Data Ownership</h2>
        We respect your right to ownership of content created or stored by you.
        You own the content created or stored by you. Unless specifically
        permitted by you, your use of the Services does not grant Exterview the
        license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the
        content created by you or stored in your user account for Exterview’s
        commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant Exterview
        permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat,

        content and the consequences of its transmission or publication. If you
        are a publisher of news and current affairs content as defined under
        Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics
        Code) Rules 2021, you shall furnish details to the Ministry of
        Information and Broadcasting as required by rule 18. Any content made
        public will be publicly accessible through the internet and may be
        crawled and indexed by search engines. You are responsible for ensuring
        that you do not accidentally make any private content publicly
        available. Any content that you may receive from other users of the
        Services, is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use
        only and you agree not to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit,
        broadcast, display, sell, license or otherwise exploit such content for

        the rights to such content. In the course of using any of the Services,
        if you come across any content with copyright notice(s) or any copy
        protection feature(s), you agree not to remove such copyright notice(s)
        or disable such copy protection feature(s) as the case may be. By making
        any copyrighted/copyrightable content available on any of the Services
        you affirm that you have the consent, authorization or permission, as
        the case may be from every person who may claim any rights in such
        content to make such content available in such manner. Further, by
        making any content available in the manner aforementioned, you expressly
        agree that Exterview will have the right to block access to or remove
        such content made available by you if Exterview receives complaints
        concerning any illegality or infringement of third party rights in such
        content. By using any of the Services and transmitting or publishing any
        content using such Service, you expressly consent to determination of
        questions of illegality or infringement of third party rights in such
        content by the agent designated by Exterview for this purpose.
